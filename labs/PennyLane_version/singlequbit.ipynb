    "A common use of the  gate is in initializing the state of a qubit at the beginning of an algorithm. Quite often, we would like our qubits to start in state  (which is the default in PennyLane), however there are many cases where we instead would like to start from Complete the function below by using qml.PauliX to initialize the qubit's state to  or based on an input flag. Then, use qml.QubitUnitary to apply the provided unitary U."
